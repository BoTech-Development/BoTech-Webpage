# Project: Double Static Part for Fischertechnik
I like building with Fischertechnik, but unfortunately it lacks stable parts and parts that allow you to build quickly.
That's why I developed a static part that allows you to build as quickly and stably as possible with Fischertechnik.


## Current Status:
1. Since the grooves used to connect the thin Fischertechnik static connectors are spaced incorrectly from each other, there will be other versions of this part.
