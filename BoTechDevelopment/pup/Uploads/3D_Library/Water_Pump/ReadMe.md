# Project: Water Pump
The water pump project had no direct intention. Rather, this short project was born out of boredom. The goal was to develop a pump that:
1. Fits a certain motor from my collection.
2. Can transport a lot of water using the motor.
   - Above all, a fast flow rate should be achieved.
3. Is compatible with the standard hose diameter of 13mm.
4. Sucks in the water using a hose connection.
